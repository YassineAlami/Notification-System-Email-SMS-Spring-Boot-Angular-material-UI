Below are simulation videos showcasing the key features of the app. Each video demonstrates the use of various features, accompanied by a voice-over explanation.
<br><br>

Display of Notifications : <br><br>
Our app includes a page dedicated to displaying notifications in a table format, which contains all relevant details. <br>
For the notification content column, which is essentially the message's body to be sent to recipients, only the first few words are visible. When the user hovers over the content column, a tooltip appears, showing the full message.<br><br>
Notifications that have been sent will display a delivery date, while those scheduled for future dispatch will show an estimated delivery date. <br><br>
Additionally, each notification is linked to a specific delivery. If a notification doesn't belong to any delivery, an icon will indicate this.<br><br>
The last column of the table shows the notification's status. Clicking on it will redirect the user to the page where they can manage the delivery associated with that notification.<br><br>

Creation of Notifications :<br><br>
To create a notification, the first step is to select its type. Each type has a list of associated templates. Once a template is chosen, dynamic input fields will appear, allowing the user to enter relevant data, such as the meeting date, location, and other specifics. These inputs vary depending on the selected template.<br><br>
A notification can be created with just the type, template, and dynamic inputs. However, additional details can be added to complete the notification, such as specifying the recipients (targets). Users can also assign the notification to a particular delivery, if applicable.<br><br>

Send Entier Deliveries Or Notification Per Notification <br><br>

On this page, we can view general statistics related to the delivery containing the selected notification, such as its status (pending, sent, etc.), the delivery method (email, SMS, etc.), and the number of recipients. There is also a section for visualizing and managing the various notifications within the delivery.<br><br>
For each delivery, we can see a list of recipients and the message content. It is possible to send an individual notification from the delivery, but doing so will remove it from the current delivery and create a new one containing only that notification. <br><br>
Alternatively, the entire delivery can be sent, which includes all of its notifications.<br><br>
