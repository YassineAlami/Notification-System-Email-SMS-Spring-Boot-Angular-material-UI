Below are simulation videos showcasing the key features of the app. Each video demonstrates the use of various features, accompanied by a voice-over explanation.


Display of Notifications :

Our app includes a page dedicated to displaying notifications in a table format, which contains all relevant details. <br>
For the notification content column, which is essentially the message's body to be sent to recipients, only the first few words are visible. When the user hovers over the content column, a tooltip appears, showing the full message.<br><br>
Notifications that have been sent will display a delivery date, while those scheduled for future dispatch will show an estimated delivery date. <br><br>
Additionally, each notification is linked to a specific delivery. If a notification doesn't belong to any delivery, an icon will indicate this.<br><br>
The last column of the table shows the notification's status. Clicking on it will redirect the user to the page where they can manage the delivery associated with that notification.<br><br>
